# SmarterScope

SmarterScope is an AI-powered application designed to help insurance adjusters **automate the roof scope sheet portion of a claim**, significantly reducing manual effort and claim cycle time.

The platform is built specifically for **insurance adjusters at SeekNow**, combining geolocation technology and AI-driven analysis to generate accurate roof scope data faster and more consistently than traditional workflows.

## 🚀 Problem

Roof claims are one of the most time-consuming parts of property insurance adjusting. Adjusters often spend hours:

- Manually locating properties
- Capturing roof imagery
- Measuring and identifying roof features
- Building scope sheets by hand

This process slows down claim resolution, introduces inconsistencies, and increases operational costs.

---

## 💡 Solution

SmarterScope automates the most repetitive and time-intensive parts of roof claims by:

- Using **geolocation data** to identify and capture roof imagery
- Applying **AI-driven analysis** to interpret roof structures
- Automatically generating **roof scope data** used in insurance claims

The result is a faster, more reliable workflow that allows adjusters to focus on decision-making instead of manual data entry.
